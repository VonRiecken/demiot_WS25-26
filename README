📍 Course: DEMIoT — Data Engineering & Management with Internet of Things
👥 Team: Group 4
📆 Semester: Winter Semester 25/26

📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Data Engineering & Management with IoT (DEMIoT) course.
Our team aims to design and implement an IoT-driven data pipeline that collects, processes, stores, and visualises sensor data.

The project covers:
- IoT data ingestion
- Programming of the ESP32
- Data storage
- Analytics & visualisation
- Project documentation & collaboration workflow


🔧 Tech Stack
Languages:
- Python (for project package)
- Arduino (C++)

Tools & Services:
- ESP32 board
  - LDR sensor
  - resistor
  - WiFi sender
- MQTT Broker
  - mosquitto server is being used
- Arduino
  - Boards:
    - Arduino AVR Boards by Arduino
    - ESP32 Dev Module
  - Libraries
    - Adafruit BMP280
    - Adafruit BusIO
    - Adafruit Unified Sensor
    - Arduinojson by Benoit Blanchon
    - PubSubClient
- Database (InfluxDB)
- NodeRed
- Visualisation framework (Grafana, Plotly, Streamlit, etc.)
- GitHub (version control + collaboration)


General process:
1 - Download and setup required tech stack and tools
2 - Program ESP32 through arduino to take LDR readings
3 - Collect light measurement data with Luxmeter and also ESP32
4 - Run calibration to convert LDR sensor to LUX
5 - Program ESP32 to collect LDR readings, convert to LUX, and upload (publish to MQTT)
6 - Use NodeRed to direct MQTT workflow
7 - MQTT topics will be uploaded to InfluxDB
8 - Influx will need to be processed and put into a visualisation dashboard
